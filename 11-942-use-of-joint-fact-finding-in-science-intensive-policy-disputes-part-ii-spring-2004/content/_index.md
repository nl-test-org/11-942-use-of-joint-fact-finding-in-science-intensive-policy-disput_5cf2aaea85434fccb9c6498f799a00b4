This course makes up the second half of a year-long seminar on Joint Fact Finding in Science-Intensive Disputes. In [11.941](/courses/11-941-use-of-joint-fact-finding-in-science-intensive-policy-disputes-part-i-fall-2003), the first half of the seminar, students analyzed and discussed cases that involved or that should have involved Joint Fact Finding of various kinds. In this portion, students concentrate on gathering information to assist in resolving the Cape Wind project, the dispute concerning the placement of wind farms in waters adjacent to Nantucket. Students will lay the groundwork for a collaborative project that includes Federal and State agencies, academic institutions and non-profits.
