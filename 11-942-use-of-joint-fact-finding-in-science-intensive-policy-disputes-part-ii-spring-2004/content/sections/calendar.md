| 1 | Introduction and Overview  {{< br >}}   {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Prof. Susskind and Dr. Karl will describe the goals and scope of the class. We will discuss the opportunity the class will have in helping to develop a project using a Joint Fact Finding approach to address the Cape Wind controversy and the broader implications this approach has for resolving environmental disputes Nation-wide. Are we nearing a paradigm shift in the approach to environmental policy-making? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 2 | Discussion of ways scientific information is normally used in the policy-making process. We will contrast the traditional adversarial approach to environmental policy with a collaborative problem solving approach that seeks to build consensus. The point s of view of the scientist and policy maker will be considered. |
| 3 | Presentation of fall semester student papers as part of the review of concepts and topics covered in the fall. |
| 4 | Student paper presentation and discussion continued. Based on this review and discussion we will generate a set of questions not explored and answered in the fall seminar, which will help guide development of a joint fact finding model to environmental policy. |
| 5 | Review the status of the Cape Wind application process. |
| 6 | Discuss potential future sites of offshore wind energy and explore a collaborative process approach to the permitting and leasing of these sites. Discuss a citizen-based, collaborative problem solving approach to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that includes an adaptive management and monitoring and assessment component. |
| 7 | Discuss and develop a proposal that takes a joint fact finding approach to the Cape Wind issue by building on the efforts of the fall semester class. |
| 8 | Discussion of role-play simulations as learning and research tools with examples of actual simulations. |
| 9 | As preparation for developing a role-play simulation that places the Cape Wind issue in the context of a collaborative process that includes joint fact finding, the students will play two simulations this week. Play "Framing a Joint Fact Finding Mission Statement in a Contested Ecosystem Management Situation." |
| 10 | Play "Joint Fact Finding Simulation - A New Discovery in the Fishery." |
| 11 | Begin design of role-play based on the Cape Wind issue. The purpose of the simulation is to introduce participants to joint fact finding and to an environmental policy process that is based on collaborative problem solving and consensus decision-making. |
| 12 | Simulation development. |
| 13 | The possibility for students whose schedules permit to participate in "Coastal Wind Development in the Northeast-State of the Science Workshop;" a workshop of Northeast region scientists from USGS, NPS, FWS and MMS convened by USGS and facilitated by CBI held in Sudbury. |
| 14 | Invite outside participants to play the Cape Wind simulation to rehearse it. |
| 15 | Revise the simulation and prepare teaching notes based on the rehearsal. |
| 16 | Develop a web page so that the simulation and papers from the fall semester can be accessed over the Internet. Prepare simulation and papers for publication as part of the USGS/MIT/Harvard working paper series.
